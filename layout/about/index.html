One day as I was going through my first semester in college at BYU Provo, a voice inside told me to "listen with my eyes." College was a challenge and I struggled to learn, as I still do. But one thing that became clear was that creating was not only a way of life for me... it was life. I take inspiration from just that; my internal experience and surroundings. Though so much of my work is introspective and personal, I believe the world could benefit from hearing my voice in the form of a paintbrush. I specialize in oil painting portraiture. I also love still-life, abstract, and many different mediums; especially watercolor and ballpoint pen. I consider myself a developing artist with potential to unlock and so much to discover, and I'm here to offer what I have. My themes are centered around my spirituality, which is Christian, and the places I see Him, which is everywhere. I would consider painting as a form of worship, as so much of my learning and love has flowed through my art. Some of my biggest artistic accomplishments have happened only with myself, and more have followed with my dear friends and family. But it's only the beginning.

It's a gift not only to see beautiful things, but to see things beautifully.

My name is Tayler Michele Whitaker, I'm an artist and student at BYU Provo Studying Exercise and Wellness. I am 22 years old and was born in Davis County, UT to Shea and Kristin Whitaker. I graduated Copper Hills High in West Jordan, class of 2021. I completed a service mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in 2023. In the future I hope to graduate and go on to become a nutritional therapist and have a family of my own. Though I am pursuing another career, I don't consider painting a hobby. Nor do I consider it a side gig. I consider it a part of myself, and I'd like to give a piece to you.
